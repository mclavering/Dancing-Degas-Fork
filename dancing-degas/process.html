                <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
                <p>For our first sprint we wanted to test out a drawing mechanism. No one on our team had experience
                    with gantry so we wanted to learn about them first in order to decide the scope of our project. We
                    made a vertical X-Y gantry in less than two weeks that used servo motors and weight to center the
                    pen holder in the middle. We found after our sprint that the design worked well but only for one
                    color and we felt that in order to fully visualize music, we need multiple. A multiple color
                    mechanism would be difficult with a vertical gantry system because of gravity so we decided to shift
                    to a horizontal X-Y gantry like those found in 3d printers. We also found that our initial design
                    was pretty quick and we wanted more of a challenge. Our software/electrical team found that
                    calibrating the motors took more time than expected and knew that it needed more attention in the
                    future.</p>

                <h3>Software</h3>
                <p>
                    For Sprint 1, software focused on writing scripts to control the servos in order to
                    draw different shapes with out gantry. We discovered that while the code worked for the
                    servos
                    when they were not integrated, upon integration the pulleys would slip off the servos, which
                    meant we were not able to test if the shapes were drawn correctly.
                </p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
                        <p>
                            Since we decided to pivot towards a horizontal gantry system, we turned our
                            attention towards figuring out how we wanted to process the audio data. As we
                            brainstormed
                            potential methods, we focused on having a simple circuit with LEDs that lit up when
                            audio
                            input was detected.

                    <p>
                        At the end of this sprint, we decided that our next priority was to have the drawing
                        commands be different depending on audio input -- essentially integrating
                        our audio processing with gantry control. However, we knew this would be a significant
                        change
                        as we would also be dealing with a different gantry system and different motors.

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
                <p>In sprint 2 we made a lot of progress. We fully shifted to a horizontal X-Y gantry and were able to
                    achieve a working gantry in two weeks. We had to order a lot of our parts this sprint like v slot
                    rails, wheels, stepper motors, belts, and pulleys. For the software side, we translated Cartesian
                    coordinate to motor motion and began working on the spiral art design. From this sprint, we decided
                    to stick with the mechanical design but to work on reducing friction and adding stability. We
                    decided that we needed a CNC motor shield which is usually used for most X-Y gantry.</p>

                            For sprint 2, the software team decided that to visualize music using spirographs.
                            Consequently, we dedicated time to understanding the formulae that produce
                            spirographs and
                            translating the formulae into functions that return positions. Software modified
                            these
                            formulae by having the parameters be determined by the most salient frequencies in
                            the
                            fourier transform of the audio signal. A deeper expalantion of these formulae can be
                            found
                            on the <a href="software.html">Software page</a>.

                <p>
                    Additionally, software also
                    figure out simple motor control commands through Arduino. However, we ultimately decided to
                    switch to using the CNC shield to simplify the simultaneous movement of multiple motors.

                <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
                <p>Our last sprint mainly focused on the spiral art algorithm and converting the position to Gcode
                    commands. We also built a user interface where the user can pick a song. For the mechanical side, we
                    added a base, acrylic board, and the color changing mechanism. We worked a lot as a whole team on
                    integrating and testing small problems during this sprint and after. </p>

                <h3>Software</h3>
                <p>For sprint 3, the software team divided their efforts between integrating with the new CNC
                    shield and developing a user interface.</p>
                <p>To integrate with the CNC shield, the software team decided to use GCode and GRBL. Software
                    learned how to create and write to GCode files, as well as which GCode commands were the
                    most pertinent for the project. Additionally, software also learned how to stream the GCode
                    files to the CNC shield for motor movemnt. A deeper explanation of this process can be found
                    on the <a href="software.html">Software page</a>.</p>

                            For the interface component of the project, the software team chose to use Python
                            and
                            tkinter in order to develop a simple in which the user could enter a song for
                            visualization.
                            Whilst developing the interface, the software team decided to switch from the
                            fourier
                            transforms used in sprint 2 to using the Spotify API for the audio data. A deeper

                <h3>Software</h3>
                <p>The first task the software team tackled was the abilitity to have multiple concentic
                    spirographs. The problems we had in previous sprints with secondary spirographs appearing in
                    incorrect locations was resolved by having all of the spiral positions be dependent on
                    previous spirals. To implement the color changing mechanism, we modified how we calibrated
                    the motor responsible for the color wheel, which enabled easy transition between colors.
