                <h3>Mechanical System Overview</h3>
                <p>We chose to base the system on a horizontal x-y gantry to provide the most flexibility in the type of
                    visualization we could produce. The goal was to create a gantry that could move a pen over a piece
                    of paper according to the design generated by the music visualization software and that the
                    mechanism could also change the color of the pen. We also aimed to minimize the use of materials and
                    to make the machine easy to use. We designed the drawing gantry in SolidWorks, and the primary
                    manufacturing techniques were 3D printing and laser cutting, which allowed us to easily make edits
                    to our prototypes.
                </p>

                    <div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
                        <h3>Gantry</h3>
                        <p>The frame of the gantry is a U-shape made of two (dimensions) bars of 20mm x 20mm v-slot
                            extruded
                            aluminum, crossed on one end by a (dimensions) bar of the same material. Crossing both of
                            the y-axis
                            bars is an x-axis bar of the same aluminum extrusion, which is mounted to each y-axis bar on
                            a
                            rolling carriage made from laser cut MDF so that the entire bar can slide in the
                            y-direction.
                            Another carriage, which holds the color changing motor and pens, is mounted vertically on
                            the x-axis
                            bar. The frame is primarily held together by screws and nuts inserted in the rails, which
                            hold in
                            place the motor and pulley mounts as well as the 3D printed L-brackets at the corner of the
                            frame.
                            The aluminum is mounted to a plywood base, which adds a structure to place the drawing
                            surface on
                            and ensures that the frame is held at perpendicular angles, as we found that without this
                            support
                            the entire frame would shift and prevent the x-axis rail from moving across the entire
                            y-axis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The x-y motion is driven by two NEMA 17 stepper motors, one for each axis. The y-axis motor
                            is
                            mounted with a 3D printed mount to the end of one of the y-axis bars, on the other end of
                            this bar
                            is another mount with a (6mm) pulley. Between these is a timing belt that attaches to the
                            carriage.
                            On the opposite side there is no motor, but a corresponding pair of pulleys and belts. In
                            the
                            interest of simplicity, we wanted to use only one motor to move the y-axis. One challenge
                            with this
                            was overcoming the torque created by having a friction force from the opposite carriage
                            applied at a
                            distance from the applied force of the motor (figure). Our first stepper motor was not quite
                            strong enough to overcome this torque, so we exchanged it for a stronger Nema 17 stepper
                            motor with 42 N-cm of torque.
